# Vaccines-Prediction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving two types of vaccines: the xyz flu vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine. The predictions are made based on various demographic, behavioral, and opinion-based features.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to predict two probabilities: one for xyz_vaccine and one for seasonal_vaccine. Both target variables are binary (0 = No, 1 = Yes). This is a multilabel classification problem, evaluated using the ROC AUC score.
